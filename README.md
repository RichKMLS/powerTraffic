> Useful if the locations have 1 general path you could take. If Google decides to reoute you this does not reflect that change—this simply shows you the best driving time available. To gain that functionality more would need to be added to this script—or you could split your driving distance into several smaller distances and sum the values together if you wanted to force google to show you a specific route.
